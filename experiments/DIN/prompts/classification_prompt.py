Q: "Find the buildings which have rooms with capacity more than 50."
schema_links: [classroom.building,classroom.capacity,50]
A: Let's think step by step. The SQL query for the question "Find the buildings which have rooms with capacity more than 50." needs these 
tables = [classroom], so we don't need JOIN.
Plus, it doesn't require nested queries with (INTERSECT, UNION, EXCEPT, IN, NOT IN), and we need the answer to the questions = [""].
So, we don't need JOIN and don't need nested queries, then the the SQL query can be classified as "EASY".
