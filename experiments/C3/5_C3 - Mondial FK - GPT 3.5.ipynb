In this case, the country name is the most relevant column as it directly represents the names of the countries. The code column is also included because it is a foreign key in the ismember table, indicating the connection between countries and organizations. Similarly, in the organization table, the country column is relevant as it represents the country of the organization, and the abbreviation column is included as it is a foreign key in the ismember table.
